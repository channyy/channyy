- 👋 Hi, I’m @channyy
- 👀 I’m interested in projects related to home products and ways to design my home with the use of code with related products. (Like LEDS that follow musical beats!)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are related to home-design
- 📫 How to reach me: through my GitHub Page for now!
